# alfred-fix-my-keyboard

I use a Windows keyboard with macOS so I need to swap Option and Command to get a more natural layout. But sometimes macOS forgets my keyboard modifier keys for *reasons*. Configuring them in System Preferences isn't too hard but it's tedious to do it over and over each day. Instead I made a workflow to automate the whole thing.

Set the `fixmykeyboardname` variable to match the name of your keyboard (as shown in the dropdown in the Modifier Keys sheet of the Keyboard preference pane) and that's it. Use the `fmk` keyword and give the script a moment to do its thing.
